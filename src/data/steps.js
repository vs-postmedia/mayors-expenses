    'Expenses for the Vancouver mayor’s office were <strong>$1.2 million</strong> in 2024, most of which went to <span class="grey-03">salaries</span>. But in Ken Sim’s administration, discretionary expenses like <span class="purple-03">meeting costs</span> and <span class="green-01">transportation</span> were significantly higher than in either of the previous two administrations.<span class="scroll-more">Scroll for more...</span>',
    '#In 2024, 96% of <span class="green-01">transportation costs</span> were from a leased vehicle for staff use. Transportation costs for previous administrations were almost entirely for taxis, EVOs and transit.',
    'In 2024, <span class="purple-03">meeting expenses</span> were more than double of any year since at least 2016, according to city data.',
    'Most <span class="purple-01">miscellaneous</span> expenses were for legal costs related to a code of conduct complaint, which was dismissed as unfounded in 2024.',
    'Councillors from Sim’s ABC party also used parts of their own discretionary budgets to help pay for <span class="blue-01">staff</span> in the mayor’s office.'
